# Breaking into Blue: My CySA+ Journey
Welcome to my cybersecurity learning journal! This repository tracks my progress, notes, and hands-on labs as I work towards the CompTIA CySA+ certification.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Luiz Felipe (aka Zan) â€” an aspiring cybersecurity analyst based in Brazil with a strong passion for Blue Team operations and digital defense. I'm documenting my journey here to stay accountable, share what I learn, and connect with fellow learners and potential mentors along the way.

I originally earned a degree in Audiovisual Production but found my true calling in cybersecurity after four years as an entrepreneur in the financial and loan services sector. Since 2023, Iâ€™ve been pursuing a degree in Computer Science, which I expect to complete by 2027 â€” building a solid foundation in computing to complement my practical cybersecurity training.

I believe my background in banking systems and data protection laws brings a unique perspective to the field â€” especially when it comes to understanding risk, compliance, and digital trust.
