## 💬 My Diary and Thoughts
<small>
I’ve been really busy lately with family and work stuff, but I’ve managed to keep studying as much as I can. Today, as I write this, I’m back to my study pace of 8–10 hours a day, and I’ve got a lot to share.
I studied Windows CMD, PowerShell, and Linux shells (I already had some experience before, so that was sweet). I learned about task and file management in shells, network troubleshooting, and then created a Locker Script in Bash (I love Linux) and a script to search for flags inside .log files.

Next up after command lines, I tackled network protocols. I’m somewhat familiar with the topic, but I studied it anyway—and it was definitely the right call. I discovered the mnemonic “Please Do Not Throw Spinach Pizza Away” for the OSI model layers, and I absolutely love it. Now I never forget the order: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

But above all, my most fun exercise so far was last night: a Wireshark intro challenge! On TryHackMe, I had to analyze HTTPS packets and find a flag. First, I had to find and insert the TLS key into Wireshark, then hunt down the right packet containing a password flag. It took me 40 minutes to find it, but it was super fun and totally rewarding—I’m really excited!

I’m jumping back into Wireshark studies right now! 😁
