## ✅ What I Did Today

- Created my GitHub repo to document this epic journey — big moves only!  
- Finished **Linux Fundamentals 1, 2, 3** on TryHackMe 🐧💥 (This penguin had no chance)  
- Started **Windows Fundamentals** (Hello, blue screen of *not* death)   
- Set clear goals and crafted a README that means business

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Refreshed Linux basics: commands, filesystems, and permissions (`chmod 777 my motivation today`)  
- Understood package managers — APT = Minecraft Balm for mods, basically  
- Realized every log *does* tell a story (now gotta learn the language) 
- Struggled with SCP over SSH for the first time, but I nailed it
- Took first steps into Windows user management and system navigation
- Learned how to manage crontab in Bash
- Bash all day!

## 💬 My Diary and Thoughts

Woke up with Bash and I’ll sleep with Bash tonight — feeling like I’m inside the matrix.  
Bash intimidated me at first, but after just two days, I beat it and learned a lot.  
Typing commands faster than yesterday and having fun with every challenge I crush.

## 🧩 Notes

- GPG = security ninja for verifying software signatures  
- APT = Linux’s own mod loader, but for programs  
- Never hesitate to ask for help — bots, mentors, and even chatty AI can be allies

## 🔄 Tomorrow's Plan

- Finish Windows Fundamentals on TryHackMe 
- Organize journal better — maybe tag each entry by topic or mood?  
- Keep the energy high, the attitude cheeky, and the progress real  
- Pet my cats and drink water (and coffee)
