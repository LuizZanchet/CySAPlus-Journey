## 💬 My Diary and Thoughts
<small>
It's been a while since I last wrote. These days, I’ve learned a lot of things (just John the Ripper took me four days of study).

Starting with Cryptography Basics, I studied some historical ciphers, like the Caesar Cipher, and that was my introduction to Public Key Cryptography.

I’m the kind of guy who only moves to the next step after understanding something crystal clear, so I spent a few hours digging into asymmetric encryption and public keys. 
Diffie-Hellman seemed insecure at first because of its obvious MiTM vulnerability, but then I reached the topic of authentication (digital signatures and certificates),
and public keys started to make more sense to me.

I manually set up my PowerShell with aliases for John the Ripper, Hash-ID, and Hashcat to start the game.
After going through the basics of hashing, I used **John the Ripper** to crack:

+ Basic hashes
+ Windows authentication hashes (NTLM)
+ /etc/shadow hashes
+ Single crack mode
+ WinRAR and 7-Zip password hashes
+ SSH keys
+ And even created some custom rules for John

(Setting up my system took some time, but in the end, it was fun — and now I have a ready arsenal!)

So the fun part started: **Exploitation Basics**.
Today I explored **Moniker Link (CVE-2024-21413)** in a TryHackMe lab.
It was super easy, not gonna lie, but definitely fun.
