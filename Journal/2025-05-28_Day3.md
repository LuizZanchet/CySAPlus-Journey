# 🛡️ Day 3 — Windows Fundamentals and AD DS

## 💬 My Diary and Thoughts

Right now it's the end of Day 3 and I'm really tired. The last two days were only Windows Fundamentals for hours straight,
not gonna lie, Bash was super fun, and Win Fundamentals felt boring in comparison. But now that I'm diving into AD DS, it's becoming interesting again (for me).
I haven't finished this topic yet, I'll leave it to tomorrow, too tired to keep going, almost 9:00 PM.

## 🧠 What I Learned
+ Windows services in different versions
+ NTFS, FAT16/FAT32, HPFS
+ ADS, got curious and spent some hours creating theory about malware hidden in ADS
+ User Groups, permissions
+ Task Manager and System32 files
+ Some of PowerShell, UAC, Windows Registry, Windows Update, Firewall and Virus/Threat protection
+ BitLocker, TPM, VSS

(Tbh, now that I'm listing it all, I completely devoured the Windows content)

## 🔄 Tomorrow's Plan
+ Finish AD DS basics
+ Dive into command line: Windows Command Line, PowerShell and Linux Shells (Can I finish all of this in a single 12-hour study session?)
