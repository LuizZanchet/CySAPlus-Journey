It's been A LOT since I wrote down here, but a lot of things happened. First of all: I Got my CyberSecurity 101 certificate from TryHackMe

Aaaaannndd... I got an Internship on IT Support Technician!!!!!! Well, I'm so happy with that, I've been learning a lot in this new job!
I'm working at Green Tecnologia and already experienced configuration/troubleshooting of: network, linux, printers, ad/ds, well
a lot of configs and troubleshooting you see. I've been doing both remote and onsite work, it's been awesome. A specific problem-solving case stood out to me: server access via VPN from a user’s machine stopped working. I investigated it deeply, only to discover,after my senior’s input, that the user’s IP range was in the same subnet as the server. We temporarily disabled DHCP on the user’s network until the ISP changed the network range.

Furthermnore, I've been doing Advent of Cyber challenges on TryHackMe, a Christmas special event.
