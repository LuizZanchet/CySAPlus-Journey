## ✅ What I Did Today

- Created my GitHub repo to document this epic journey — big moves only!  
- Finished **Linux Fundamentals 1, 2, 3** on TryHackMe 🐧💥 (This penguin had no chance)  
- Started **Windows Fundamentals** (Hello, blue screen of *not* death)   
- Set clear goals and crafted a README that means business

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Refreshed Linux basics: commands, filesystems, and permissions (`chmod 777 my motivation today`)  
- Understood package managers — APT = Minecraft Balm for mods, basically  
- Took first steps into Windows user management and system navigation  
- Realized every log *does* tell a story (now gotta learn the language) 
- Struggled with SCP over SSH for the first time, but I nailed it
- Still highly motivated, can't wait to let my brain rest and come back strong tomorrow

## 💬 Reflection

Today was all about laying the groundwork. Brain's sweating but the fire’s lit.  
Sleep is my power-up, focus is my weapon, and discipline is my shield.  
One shell at a time, one log at a time — I’m ready to defend.

## 🧩 Notes

- GPG = security ninja for verifying software signatures  
- APT = Linux’s own mod loader, but for programs  
- Never hesitate to ask for help — bots, mentors, and even chatty AI can be allies

## 🔄 Tomorrow's Plan

- Finish Windows Fundamentals on TryHackMe 
- Organize journal better — maybe tag each entry by topic or mood?  
- Keep the energy high, the attitude cheeky, and the progress real  
- Pet my cats and drink water (and coffee)
